I'm Kenny, a full-stack engineer with experience in TypeScript + React and Python + Django. I have a couple years of experience working at an early-stage startup, [Artifact](https://heyartifact.com).

Currently working on:
- A personal project to organize recipes and make calorie-counting easier. Learning Flask for the [backend](https://github.com/fitzgeraldkd/nutrition-backend).
- My debut album, as well as a companion app to share my music (live [here](https://www.kenneth-music.com/) and source code [here](https://github.com/fitzgeraldkd/music)).
- [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/).
