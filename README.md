I'm Kenny, a full-stack engineer with experience in TypeScript + React and Python + Django. I have a couple years of experience working at an early-stage startup, [Artifact](https://heyartifact.com).

Currently working on:
- A personal project to organize recipes and make calorie-counting easier. Learning Flask for the [backend](https://github.com/fitzgeraldkd/nutrition-backend). 
- [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/).
