I'm Kenny, a full-stack engineer with experience in TypeScript + React and Python + Django. I have a couple years of experience working at an early-stage startup, [Artifact](https://heyartifact.com).

Currently working on:
- A personal project to organize recipes and make calorie-counting easier. Python/Flask/Postgres for the [backend](https://github.com/fitzgeraldkd/nutrition-backend) and TypeScript/React for the [frontend](https://github.com/fitzgeraldkd/nutrition-frontend).
- My debut album, as well as a companion app to share my music (live [here](https://www.kenneth-music.com/) and source code [here](https://github.com/fitzgeraldkd/music)).
- Getting caught up on [Advent of Code](https://github.com/fitzgeraldkd/advent-of-code).
